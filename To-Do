- Convert coordinates to string in entities and make constructors in entities and DTOs convert between string and list of coordinates
- Change all entities constructors to receive ID instead of names
- Change hash function to Entities which are "Set" in other entities

- Test findAll and findById for all the resources
- Add "@RequestHeader(value = "Authorization") String token" and validate user type in any add, update and delete function on controller
- Rethinking about mapped-by (create the foreign key, what can be stand on it's own and what should be deleted if the first is deleted)
