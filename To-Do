Important:
- Add validations to logics - Oleg
- Add exception in all logics (per marked "TODO") - Aviad

To Do Later:
- Ensure comments include line breaks
- Add thickness to joint. If imperial - selected from table. If metric - manual input. Validate against joiner and PSP







Done:
- Should all double variables be "List" or separate items in DTO? (Currently uncertain in Joint) - Resolved Many to Many - Aviad
- Get list of links (ManyToMany). Oleg to decide "Main" for each - Aviad
- Modify DTO constructors, per example in entities by Aviad - Oleg
- Create Dal, Logic, Controller to all Entities - Aviad
- Add error handling (ErrorBean DTO, ErrorType Enum, Error handler class, ApplicationError class) - Oleg
- Read about Cascade types and orphanRemoval = true to determine each cascade - Oleg + Aviad
- Find out how to create a full list with fitting thickness - Oleg
- Find how to validate file type - Aviad
- Change all dals to PagingAndSortingRepository - Aviad
- Add cache to "get all" functions of basic parameters - Oleg
- For all validations which are "isExist" but not mandatory field - Find alternative to throwing error (if null - return. in not - continue validation) - Oleg
- Resolve sheets validations: Sheets should not be list of Integers, due to the possibility of several sheets per P&ID, and several P&Ids per isometric - Oleg
- Create new resource "File" with resourceName (String), resourceType (Enum), file (byte[]) and move all files management to new table, incl. validations - Oleg
- Add controller for File - Oleg
- DTO to not have List/Set variables (Separate to "1" & "2") - Oleg
- To decide Cascade types - Aviad
- Revision validation in File: check that does not exist in previous revisions - Oleg
